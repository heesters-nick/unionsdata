## [0.1.0] - 2025-10-30
Initial public release of `unionsdata`. This release provides a CLI and Python package to download UNIONS imaging data in a reproducible way, using a YAML configuration, XDG user directories, and a concurrent download engine.

### Added

#### CLI and user interface
- Top level CLI entry point `unionsdata`.
- Subcommands for common tasks:
  - `unionsdata init` to copy the default config into the user config directory (for example `~/.config/unionsdata/config.yaml`).
  - `unionsdata edit` to open the user config in the system editor.
  - `unionsdata validate` to check the current config against the Pydantic model.
  - `unionsdata download` to actually download tiles or cutouts based on the selected input mode.
- Global options for verbosity, config path override, and dry runs.
- Consistent exit codes and structured logging so this can be used in automation.

#### Configuration system
- YAML based configuration with a default file shipped inside the package.
- XDG aware lookup, the application prefers a user specific config in `~/.config/unionsdata/` if present.
- Pydantic models that validate paths, URIs and survey parameters at startup.
- Support for per environment or per cluster overrides (local, CANFAR, Narval).
- Resolution of relative paths to absolute ones at load time, so jobs run from anywhere.
- Clear error messages when required tools for remote storage are missing.

#### Download engine
- Concurrent download workers that pull jobs from a queue.
- Separate handling for tiles versus cutouts.
- Tracking of download progress per tile and per band, so partial downloads can resume.
- Atomic or temporary file writes, to avoid corrupt products when a download is interrupted.
- Timeouts and a shutdown flag so the process can stop cleanly on SIGINT.
- Logging of completed and failed downloads so users can re run only the missing ones.

#### Core logic and inputs
- Multiple input modes:
  - a list of UNIONS tile numbers,
  - a list of sky coordinates (RA, Dec),
  - a dataframe or table of objects with positions,
  - an option to download all tiles for a band.
- Mapping from band names in UNIONS to the correct remote product names.
- Support for the main UNIONS bands (CFIS, WHIGS, WISHES, Pan STARRS i and z), including the LSB r channel.
- Basic validation that the requested bands are actually available for the selected input.
- Hooks to integrate with VOSpace or CANFAR tooling if present.

#### Development and CI/CD
- Project configured with `hatch` for building and publishing.
- GitHub Actions workflow to run tests and static checks on push and pull requests.
- GitHub Actions workflow to publish to TestPyPI on pre release tags that contain `alpha`, `beta` or `rc`.
- GitHub Actions workflow to publish to PyPI on normal version tags (for example `v0.1.0`).
- A separate job to create a GitHub Release only after the PyPI publication has succeeded.

### Notes
- Actual runtime requirement: Python >= 3.11.
- The README uploaded to PyPI for this version mistakenly stated Python 3.13+. This was a documentation error and is corrected in 0.1.1.
- The CLI is intended to be stable from 0.1.x onward, but flag names may still change slightly as more back ends are added.
